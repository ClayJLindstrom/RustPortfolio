# Manta Tag

# Hello! Welcome to Manta Tag, a game where you, the last manta to be tagged, are trying to run from all the other mantas trying to tag you. Be careful, because these mantas will grow faster overtime. How long can you avoid getting tagged?

# Purpose and Goals of the project:
#   Outside of the classroom and the goal of getting a good grade, the purpose is to make a fun game involving Manta Rays in a Mantabrot galaxy.
#   Though, upon testing with bevy and discovering some unexpected difficulties with using bevy on a windows system, part of the purpose became being able to implement certain things like acceleration and potentially rigidbody physics that works for windows. The rigidbody physics did not get completed in time, but acceleration was successfully implemented!

# for building:
#   this project is a cargo project, so running "cargo build" while in the project file on your terminal should prepare the project.
#   Keep in mind that this project uses bevy, so you may need to type "cargo add bevy" into your terminal when you do this.
#   you may also need to install rust on your machine as well, if the above does not work.

# to run the project:
#   Simply running "cargo run" in your terminal before or after running "cargo build" should do the trick.
