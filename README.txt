Welcome to the game project! 
Sadly, there's only so much it can do right now.
The game has a background image and character that moves around the area (yet to be controlled).

To run, navigate into the main file and type Cargo build, then cargo run.
NOTE: this requires the bevy extension. you may have to type Cargo add bevy in order to have the project run alright.

The rest of the project hopes to build up controls for the character and some walls that the player can't cross. Honestly, Rust feels like it wasn't built for gaming. There are some plugins for game development, but is built to work in a tedious, confusing, and frankly frusterating manner. Part of the project may even be building a more friendly game engine or tools to assist in bevy, though the odds of such are very slim.
